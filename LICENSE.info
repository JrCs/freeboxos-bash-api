Ths project is fork from JrCs/freeboxos-bash-api : 
https://github.com/JrCs/freeboxos-bash-api
The original project did not licensed the code.
All modifications and addition to the library could be in a separate 
librairy but it will not be user-friendly.
So I rename the project and add several (a lot) modifications and
additions. All these additions and modifications will be under the 
LICENSE describes in the LICENSE file of this current directory.
